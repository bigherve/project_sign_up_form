# project_sign_up_form

So the task is to take a template of a website and make it into a real one, it is a sign-up form. I will do it my own way of course, so it's a basic site. Users interact with the site through a form with 6 inputs and a submit button desired output is to acquire user information so they can create account with the best oil company around. First ill tackle the HTML then the bulk of the code will be done in CSS were I will add the Midas touch a maybe some JS if i'm feeling inspired.
